# TA Pod Repo Instructions:

Thanks to some hard work from Aeshna in particular, we are setting up a system of pod-specific repos! Each pod's repo will be maintained through the pod TAs account, and students will submit their challenges via PRs. This is a NEW THING we are trying, so any and all feedback on how this goes will be extremely helpful. Here's the plan:



### BEFORE CLASS:

Here is the link to the general JTC pod repo template https://github.com/Justice-Through-Code/pod_test_repo

1. Fork this repo to your own account, and name it according to your pod number (i.e. 'pod_2' or something). Feel free to update the readme to match as well if you feel like it.

2. Following the template of the example_student_folder, make a folder in the repo named for each student in the pod. Each student's folder should have a blank/template `README.md` file in it. 


### During the challenge

Challenge instructions: https://github.com/Justice-Through-Code/pod_test_repo/blob/main/challenges/03_git_collab.md

Each student will be instructed to clone the pod-specific repo, make a branch with their name, customize their personal `README.md` file on the branch, push the branch, then submit a PR to merge their branch to main branch of the pod repo

A few things
1. Since this is a repo students will be using more this semester, emphasize good practice for where they clone the repo on their computers (i.e. somwhere they can find and easily work with). Make sure they clone the pod-specific one, not the general JTC repo!
2. When students try to push their branches (Step 4), you may need to add them as collaborators for the repo, and they may need to go into their emails to accept
3. When students set up their pull requests, make sure they are setting them up to merge to the **pod-specific repo** you forked, not the general Jutice-Through-Code one. This may not be the default base repository option, so try to make sure students are cautious at this step. 
4. For now, don't worry about closing students' branches after merging their PRs. We will eventually teach them good practice for when to start/close new branches, but we are testing out holding off on this for the reason that having to switch branches a lot might get confusing. For now, getting comfortable with submitting PRs and the basics of the collaborative workflow will be super helpful. 
5. This challenge doesn't have `git pull` in it. Let me know if you think we should add this somewhere in this one. For future challenges, we will add things to the `challenges` folder in the repo for students to pull, so this will definitely be reinforced later on.
