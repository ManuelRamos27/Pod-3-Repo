# Meats & Cheeses Return! Django challenge

In this challenge, you'll build on the Django sandwich app demonstrated in today's lesson to add a few more features! 

## Challenge steps


### Setup
1. Download [this zip file](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/141443/files/folder/django_templates) from Canvas containing the `sandwich_app.zip`. This is the code demonstrated during class today. 
    * Unzip the file and make sure to put the whole folder `mysite` into the `django_projects` folder inside personal folder in your pod repo
    * Make sure you're on a new branch in your pod repo
2. Your folder should look similar to this now (okay if it is not exactly the same):

```console
django-projects/
    django-env/
        bin/activate
    mysite/
        manage.py
        mysite/
        myapp/
    sandwich_app/
        mysite/
            db.sqlite3
            manage.py
            mysite/
            sandwich/

```


### Sandwich App Updates

3. Add a hyperlink back to the sandwich app homepage from the sandwich generator page. Test this out to make sure your hyperlink works!
4. Add a new page `/sandwich/menu` to the app showing the "full menu" of all possible sandwiches! 
    * This page should have an ordered list displaying all 150 possible sandwiches that have 1 meat, 1 cheese, and 1 topping
    * This page should stay the same when refreshed
