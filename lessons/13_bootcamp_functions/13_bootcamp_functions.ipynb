    "    # block of code\n",
    "    print('Hello World')\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not bad, but once we have more names to print, we would have to create more functions that look like `say_hello_ash` and `say_hello_paul`. Imagine trying to do that for a thousand names. Luckily, functions have something called **parameters** that will dramatically cut down the number of lines of code we have to write to accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "`name` here is called a **parameter**. A parameter is like a variable, we can call it anything we want, but the main idea is that it contains a reference to a value. When we call `say_hello('Ash')`, `name` is a parameter referring to the string value `Ash` which then gets printed as `Hello Ash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter can reference any data type we have learned so far.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def times_two(num):\n",
    "    # parameter num is an int or a float\n",

    "first_num([100, 233, 443]) # 100\n",
    "\n",
    "more_nums = [133, 445, 667, 88]\n",
    "# pass a variable containing a list\n",
    "first_num(more_nums) # 133\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple parameters\n",
    "Parameters are powerful! Even better: we can have more than one parameter. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    print(a*b)\n",
    "    \n",
    "multiply(2, 3) # 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply more than one parameter for our function, we need to separate the parameter names by a comma. Here's another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(first_name, middle_name, last_name):\n",
    "    print(f'Hi, {first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}')\n",
    "    \n",
    "greeting('George', 'Orson', 'Welles') # Hi, George Orson Welles\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Argument\n",
    "The specific value that is passed to the function at the time of calling a function is called an **argument**. Parameter is the variable between the parenthesis at the time of the function declaration. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def times_two(num):\n",
    "    # num is a parameter\n",
    "    print(num*2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2 is the argument\n",
    "times_two(2) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default arguments\n",
    "Functions can also take a default argument for a parameter. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def ice_cream(flavor='chocolate'):\n",
    "    print(f'A {flavor} ice cream sundae with a cherry on top')\n",
    "    \n",
    "ice_cream('vanilla')\n",
    "ice_cream()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword arguments\n",
    "Functions can take arguments in a `key = value` syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greeting(first_name, middle_name, last_name):\n",
    "    print(f'Hi, {first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}')\n",
