    "# 1. Importing existing python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a python library?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 'library' is a set of python functions, bundled together\n",
    "* All the functions we've been using so far come from the [python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)\n",
    "* It is possible to `import` additional libraries to get more functions\n",
    "* When we import libraries, we are pulling in more functions we can use in our python code\n",
    "* Curious about what libraries there are? Here is a [list of some commonly used ones](https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-python-libraries-and-packages-for-beginners/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing an entire library\n",
    "\n",
    "To import an existing library and use its functions in our code, we use the `import` command. \n",
    "* Usually we do this at the top of the script\n",
    "* If you see **no output**, importing has worked! \n",
    "* If importing fails, you'll get output telling you so\n",
    "  * Probably the most common reason for failed importing is if you don't already have the library installed. We'll talk about installing libraries next class!\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: importing the `os` library\n",
    "\n",
    "As one example, let's import the library [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), which will allow us to run command line functions (such `ls`, and `cd`) etc from within python. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! We've imported the `os` library and now we can use the functions it has. We'll explore this soon!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: importing the `numpy` library with the `np` alias\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now import the library [numpy](https://numpy.org/). numpy is a library with lots of extra functions for dealing with numerical data, and we use it a lot for code doing mathematical operations\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the whole library, we can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You might we wondering that the `as np` part means.\n",
    "* The `as np` means that we have [created an alias](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_as.asp) to reference the `numpy` library. \n",
    "* Now, we can call numpy by the alias (kind of like a nickname) `np` when we want to use it. We'll see that soon\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: importing a specific function from the `numpy` library\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we don't actually need all the functions in the numpy library, but just one function, called `arange()`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import arange\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of getting all the numpy functions, this will specifically import `arange()` so we can use just this one. \n",

    "* In general, when we importa a library, we specify that we are using the functions from that library with the syntax `library.function()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: using `os.system()`\n",

    "\n",
    "To clarify, this is how your two scripts should look like, one for defining the function, and the other importing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/image1.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing multiple functions from a script using `*` as a wildcard\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we had a few functions in the `custom_functions.py` script. Let's define one more that converts fahrenheit to celsius:\n",
