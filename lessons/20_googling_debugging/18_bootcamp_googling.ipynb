    "# Is it okay to google code?\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost every setting, the answer is **yes**! \n",
    "* Most experienced programmers [google a lot](https://codeahoy.com/2016/04/30/do-experienced-programmers-use-google-frequently/) to find code solutions\n",
    "* The key is making sure that if you search code out online written by someone else, you **document** where you've gotten it from, and **make sure you understand how it works for your own usage**\n",

    "# How to search for code solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have experienced, searching online for solutions for coding is a skill that can be built up. Here are some general principles that will help.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be specific! \n",
    "    * Searches like 'how to make a website in python' might give you good resources, but they might not solve your specific use case\n",
    "* But, don't be *too specific* to a situation other users would be unlikely to encounter\n",
    "    * Searching something like 'make a python function to add a song to my music library module' might not be that helpful, since not a lot of other people will have done exactly this\n",
    "* Keep it brief, and don't use extra words\n",
    "    * This might help refine your search to useful entries. For example, 'for loop python' might get you what you need more specifically than 'how to make a for loop using python programming'\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out [this page](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/03/13/googling-for-code-solutions-can-be-tricky-heres-how-to-get-started/) for some more tips on effective searches\n",
    "\n",
    "# Once you find a code solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The MOST important thing to do if you see a code solution is to **make sure you understand how to use it** if you try to use it for your own code. You can copy a snippet of code from the internet into your script to try it out, but in the long run if you don't understand how it works, you won't be able to work with it effectively in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you look for a code solution on the internet, make sure you can **convince yourself how it works** before moving on"
