#temperature challenge


# 1. Convert a temperature of 100 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
#     * Save this to a variable called `celsius_100`, and use `print()` to print out the value
#     * Is the resulting temperature you get an integer or float? How do you know?

celsius_100 = 100 #1


print(celsius_100) #1
print(type(celsius_100)) #1

input ("En")

#the resulting temperature is an integer because it does not have a decimal point. running the (type) function also reveals the temperature is <class 'int'>


# 2. Convert a temperature of 0 degrees fahrenheit to celsius
#     * Save this to a variable called `celsius_0`, and use `print()` to print out the value


#celsius_100 - 32 * 5/9
