<h2>  What is Hood Vegan ? </h2>

<p>  Hood Vegan is a branch of veganism I created which its purpose is to help people become vegan and maintain it without surrendering their culture or preferences without judgment. I intend to create a nation of people from communities all over the world, especially lower-income individuals to feel welcomed and comfortable in the vegan lifestyle. Hood Vegan will bring veganism to minority communities, stun animal cruelty, and combat the environmental crisis by recreating cultural dishes into vegan dishes, and educating neighborhoods on the impact it has on animals plus themselves because people deserve to honor their identities and animals deserve to live cruelty-free.
